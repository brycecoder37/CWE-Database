# Populating CWE/CVE Database
### Authors: Bryce Leighton & Tristan Chavez

**Description**

This repository contains Python code that can easily populate a Neo4j database with useful information regarding CWEs and CVEs. <br />We used BeautifulSoup and Selenium to web scrape and automate the extraction of data. Within the Python program, it then stores <br />this information inside of a Neo4j database, granted you have the database open while running the program.
<br />\
The next part of this project will be linking the Neo4j database to STIG, a tool developed by INL. Our goal to achieve this is to convert <br />our Neo4j database into a JSON file which can be turned into a STIX bundle From there, we should be able to simply input the STIX bundle into STIG.

**Goals**
- [x] Create web scrapers to automate the data extraction
- [x] Populate a Neo4j database with CWE/CVE information
- [ ] Connect Neo4j database to STIG
- [ ] Future plans? 

**Technologies Used**
- Neo4j
- Python
  - *BeautifulSoup*
  - *Selenium*
- STIG - Structured Threat Intelligence Graph
  - *OrientDB*
  - *STIX*
